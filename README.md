# This is a fork of GeoffreyCoulaud's guide
## Changes

* Since the 32 bit Manjaro is no longer available, I have attached a [zip](./i386-efi.zip) of the folder /boot/grub/i386-efi he mentioned in the guide.
* Added the grub.cfg file so you can just copy it to the folder.

## The guide is located [here](./manjaro-t100ta.md)
